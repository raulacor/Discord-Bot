## :notebook: How It Works

Once added to a Discord server, the bot does the following:

- Sends a **private welcome message** to users who join the server.
- Allows users to **assign or remove** themselves from a specific role using commands.
- Restricts a "secret" command only to users who have the required role.
- Logs all activity to `discord.log` for debugging or auditing.

The bot uses Discord intents to handle messages and member events, and reads your token securely using `.env`.
